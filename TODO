    * document = explain the pbkdf2 dklen parameter
    * elaborate keyderiv code to handle python >= (3.6) SHA3 and
        BLAKE2B
    * elaborate keyderiv test code to handle python <(3.6) using
        dlitz PBKDF2, pysha3, pyblake2

2018-02-02
    * need key_deriv tests                                              * DONE

    * test_counting_bloom.py needs to be elaborated to actually 
        test counters (currently just verifies that it is equivalent
        to BloomSHA)

2017-04-10
    * resurrect KeySelector class to avoid repeated calculation         * DONE
        of the same numbers                                             * DONE
    * BloomSHA.{insert,is_member} take KeySelector as arg instead       * DONE
        of b                                                            * DONE
    * CountingBloom.{insert,remove} likewise                            * DONE

    * make BloomSHA1 an abc (BloomSHA)                                  * DON'T
    * need test                                                         * DONE
