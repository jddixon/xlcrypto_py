class BloomSHA(object):
    """
    A Bloom filter for sets of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) digests.

    A Bloom filter uses a set of k hash functions to determine set
    membership.  Each hash function produces a value in the range 0..M-1.
    The filter is of size M bits, where M is a power of two.  To add a
    member to the set, apply each hash function to the new member and set
    the corresponding bit in the filter.  For M very large relative to k,
    this will normally set k bits in the filter.  To check whether x is a
    member of the set, apply each of the k hash functions to x and check
    whether the corresponding bits are set in the filter.  If any are not
    set, x is definitely not a member.  If all are set, x may be a member.
    The probability of error (the false positive rate) is
        f = (1 - e^(-kN/M))^k
    where N is the number of filter (set) members.

    This class takes advantage of the fact that SHA digests are good-
    quality pseudo-random numbers.  The k hash functions are the values
    of distinct sets of bits taken from the SHA hash.  The number of bytes
    in the filter, M, is constrained to be a power of 2; M == 2**m.  The
    number of bits in each hash function may not exceed floor(m/k), or as
    we say in Python, m//k.

    This class is designed to be thread-safe, but this has not been
    exhaustively tested.
